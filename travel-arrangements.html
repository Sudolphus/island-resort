    <h1>Arrangements for Travelling!</h1>
    <h2>Before you can be here, you have to get here!</h2>
    <p>There are many ways to travel. In case you don't of any, may I suggest:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A plane!</li>
      <li>A boat!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Seriously, you have to pick one of these. It's an island; arrangements for arrival are constrained.</p>
